    "\n",
    "This theoretical exit velocity will be used to compare against the actual exit velocity to evaluate how well a pitcher is able to suppress a hitter's exit velocity and overall prevent a hit. After researching different methods of calculating exit velocity, I decided to test out a couple different equations including one from [Dr. Nathan's analysis](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/AJP-Feb2003.pdf) of the ball bat collision. Another reference I found extremely helpful was the [FanGraphs community research](https://www.fangraphs.com/community/reverse-engineering-swing-mechanics-from-statcast-data/) article that detailed how to extract a hitter's swing speed from statcast data.<br><br>\n",
    "Dr. Nathan's equation is $V_{ball exit} = e_A \\cdot V_{ball}+(1+e_A) \\cdot V_{bat}$ where <br>\n",
    "$V_{ball exit} = $ speed of the ball as it leaves the bat <br> $V_{ball} = $ speed of ball as it leaves the bat <br> $V_{pitch} = $ speed of the pitch of the ball right before it hits the bat<br> $e_A = $ collision efficiency<br><br>\n",
    "To account for the unknown swing speed in this equation, I decided to use this equation to average a hitter's swing speed by using the actual exit velocity in all other instances this hitter hit the ball.<br><br>\n",
    "My original equation roughly estimates the exit velocity knowing the distance of how far the ball traveled and the angle at which it was launched. This estimate does not account for swing speed, air resistance, drag,or energy absorbed by the bat. This equation was in some cases extremely close to the actual exit velocity but in almost all cases was always less than the actual exit velocity (which would make sense since a ball with resistance would need to travel at a faster rate to reach the same distance as a ball with no resistance).<br><br>\n",
    "$EV = \\sqrt{g \\cdot \\frac{d}{sin{2\\theta}}}$ where <br>\n",
    "$g = 9.81$<br> $d =$ distance the ball traveled<br> $\\theta =$ launch angle<br><br>\n",
    "I also created a theoretical exit velocity from the hitter's exit velocity against other pitcher. So the exit velocity this hitter typically achieves compared to the exit velocity achieved against the specified pitcher. This also posed some challenges because for example Chris Sale played against 564 unique batters and to query each batter to get their average exit velocities would have taken approximately 56 minutes. I also considered only looking at a subset of this data where the batter played against Chris Sale in this case greater than 80 times."

    "## Analyze Suppression Stat Results\n",
    "\n",
    "This stat seems to be a good comparison of how well a pitcher suppresses exit velocity. By looking at how well a batter performs against all other pitchers and how well the batter performs against this pitcher gives an indication of a pitcher's exit velocity suppression ability compared to other pitchers. Since exit velocity is mostly due to batter performance, I examine exit velocities by each batter's ability to better account for pitcher performance. I considered averaging all exit velocities for each pitcher but I believe this gives a better representation since all batter's perform differently and this way the suppression stat depends more on how the batter performs on average compared to this pitcher.\n"
